# Machine-Learning

In this repository you will find various Machine Learning models implemented in Python and C.
These algorithms will be implemented in Python and C from Scratch. 
However, mathematical and statistical intuition required to understand these algorithms shall not be disscussed in the programs.

In order to understand the algorithms from a mathematical perspective refer to the following resources:-
